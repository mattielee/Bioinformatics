"But," she said, "this butter's bitter. \
If I bake this bitter butter, \
It would make my batter bitter. \
But a bit of better butter, \
That would make my batter better." \
So she bought a bit of butter – \
Better than her bitter butter – \
And she baked it in her batter; \
And the batter was not bitter. \
So 'twas better Betty Botter \
Bought a bit of better butter."
